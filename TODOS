I need to use map kit to determine current location and the heading
-if it doesn't sense significant movement then it should complain and 
	ask to use the compass if the phone has one or have the user manually add a direction
	
	
Remove the SpecificSearchViewController
Add an option for "other" in the genre pickerview
If selected and you click search have it bring up a password like alertview
	prompt that will allow you to enter a term --> should not accept ""
Have the splashviewcontroller compile the API request without the location
Have the searchtableviewcontroller find the location and append that to the url

So the only things that need to get passed are the url, direction, num results


"Onward"
"Cone"
"Up ahead"

Bugs to fix:

--infinite loop when it's trying to fill a number of responses that don't exist
--have a cell that says "no results found"
--Best v ratings
